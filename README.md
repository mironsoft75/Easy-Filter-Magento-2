## Documentation


#### Overview

As a standard feature, Magento facilitates product search and layered navigation with provisions to filter by attribute option values. When the number of attribute values increases, the page length also becomes long, and the end user finds it difficult to select the appropriate filter value(s). We offer a solution to this problem to all Magento developers from our experience.

Easy Filtering can be used to provide search functionality for attribute values in layered navigation. If you have a number of options in product filters, this plugin will display only five of the filter options and provide a scrollbar to find remaining filters, also to make things easy there will be a search box where you can search for filter options by just typing their names.


#### Benefits of using this extension are:

* Neat UI for search and navigation filter.
* Solution to optimize the page length due to the number of attribute values.
* Scrollbar for each and every attribute which has more than 5 values.
* Search option for the attribute when it has more than 5 values.
* Easier the customer experience results in betterment of the business
